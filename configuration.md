KAFKA_OPTIONS should be object as described in https://github.com/oleksiyk/kafka#ssl
For using with SSL, the options should be as
```

      cert: '<certificate>',
      key:  '<key>'
    }
 }
```

The following config paramaters are supported in the test environment defined in `config/test.js` and can be configured in the system environment. Note that the test config inherits all config options present in the default config and adds/overrides some config options.

## Github Verification

#### Webhook configuration

Configure a Github project with a webhook with a format like this: https://<receiver URL>:<receiver port>/webhooks/github

#### Smoke test
- Create an issue in the repo, you can see the logs in `receiver`, the `issue.created` event is generated.  You should then see the processor receive the event and process it accordingly.  It's important to validate that the issue.created event is seen by the receiver *and* the processor.  This ensures that the Kafka communication between the two services is working properly.

You can test other events, but just validating that an issue.created event is generated in Kafka is enough to smoke test the receiver is set up properly.

## Github Verification

#### Webhook configuration

Configure a Gitlab project with a webhook with a format like this: https://<receiver URL>:<receiver port>/webhooks/gitlab

#### Smoke test

See above - the steps are the same for Github and Gitlab

## Debugging
You can re-run and debug the responses to webhook requests on Github and Gitlab, in the configuration for the webhook.  This can be useful if things aren't coming through properly in the receiver.

If you see the event come into the receiver but the processor doesn't see it, make sure that Kafka is configured the same between the processor and receiver and that there aren't any Kafka connection errors being raised in the processor.
